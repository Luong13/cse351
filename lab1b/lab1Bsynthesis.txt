-----------------------------------------------------------
1) Benefit 1: There are more unique id's for more types of items

   Benefit 2: Both spaces and id will be one byte so they can be manipulated or traversed easily as char types (SPACE_MASK and ID_MASK would also be simpler)

   Benefit 3: For the rotate-left function and rotate-right function (which can be written as a modified rotate-left function), an 8-bit id would allow for easy bit shifting without losing digits

   Drawback: Each section will have less spaces for item storage

-----------------------------------------------------------
2) Difference? Y/N	Yes

   Explain: If the type of y is unknown, then the two lines of code will be different if y is anything other than a 4-byte data. For example, if y is a signed long, then y = -1 will assign y as 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF while y = 0xFFFFFFFF will just assign y as 0x00000000FFFFFFFF

-----------------------------------------------------------
3) Explain: Comparing floating points with == or != is not always accurate because floating points have to approximate for a lot of operations, such as 1/3 * 3, which will not equal 1 if we were to compare the resulting float to the value 1.

   Considerations: When we compare two floating points by comparing their difference to a threshold, we must choose a threshold high enough to cover all rounding errors of floats but low enough that two distinctly different floats are not considered as equal
